# KRR Guest Linux
This is the guest linux kernel(based on linux-6.1.0) KRR is based on for its in-guest agent development.

Apply the guest agent to a new kernel version? Just do the following step:
1. Generate the all-in-one patch file:
```
bash generate_patch.sh 
```
The patch file will be generated as `Support-KRR-guest-agent.patch`.

2. Apply this patch file to your own linux version source code:
```
git apply --reject Support-KRR-guest-agent.patch
```
Note there might be some conflicts that need to be manually resolved, see if any .rej file has been generated.

3. Before compile it, turn off the following configuration (`make menuconfig`) that has not been supported by KRR record replay yet:
```
Processor type and features -> Linux guest support
```

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
